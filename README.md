# AguilarFReverseItEndpoint

// Opening the file AguilarFReverseItEndpoint in vs code, turn on the debug feture and let it run. Once it has finished running the
// localhost page will show up and say it can't be found. Return to the debug console in vs sharp and copy + paste the http url ( example: http://localhost:5250 ).
// Open up Postman in your web browser and create a new http request. Paste the http into the request. You type in / and then the name of the controller
// including what goes in after the route in parenthesis. With another dash you input the value you wish for {num}.
// Enter send and the url should output into postman the number you have chosen {num} in reverse!

// Peer Reviewed By: Rafael Manzo - Ran program and it runs as intended, Code looks interesting will have too take a closer look in gitHub when i have more time!
